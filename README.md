# 0x16. C (aka Project Simple Shell)
We we’re tasked with making a simple UNIX CLI as our final team project for the low-level programming and algorithm quarter at ALX SE

# Introduction
Who is Thomas Shellby you ask? He is a sh-compatible CLI that resides at the gates of shell. He can do a lot like make you rip your hair out, and even curse at inanimate objects. His primary goal however is to execute commands read from the standard input or from a file he has access to.

# Usage
Shellby is awoken from his slumber with the standard input connected to the terminal. If you want to wake him up then you’ll have to compile all the .c files located in this repository by using this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh ./hsh 

Shellby can then frustrate your life whether you want him to (interactively) or whether you don’t want him to (non-interactively).
